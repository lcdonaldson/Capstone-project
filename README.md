#TIPS

This project was the final portion of my experience at Rockit Bootcamp in Tempe AZ. However, this idea has come from my
years of teaching and recognizing problems in the public education system.

TIPS stands for Teacher Informed Police Software and it was designed to open up communication lines in the event of a 
school lockdown. In the past, Teachers have sat quietly in their rooms trying to keep their students quiet as well while
waiting for an unknown amount of time for police to show up and unlock their doors. I wanted to make an application 
that would let teachers tell police the status of their room, and in turn, police could visually see the report that 
the teacher had given on a map.

Police still have to do their job and scour all of the classrooms, but this app would let them see if and where the 
problems are on a map. This allows police to prioritize where they need to be and how many officers to dedicate to any
one area.

Administration play a major role in this project too. They are many times, the initial eyes and ears for the police as
they arrive on scene. Their main job however, is to evaluate the effectiveness of the response in their schools. They
also have the ability to reset the room status back to unreported when the drill is completed. 

This project is only the front-end side of the application. A robust and secure backend will be added at a later date. I will probably do this java first and then get some help to run it in objective c or python.
This software is propriatary and as such I haven't revealed all of its features as some of them deal with security and
private information relevant to school districts. This Application is set for pilot testing in the first quarter of 
2016. Any comments or suggestions are welcome. Please enjoy TIPS.
